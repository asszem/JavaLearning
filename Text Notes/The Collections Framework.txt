Why is Vector() obsolete?

Why the default hashCode() method needs to be overwritten to use the fields of a class to generate hashcodes when storing objects to files?
	Horton, p. 562
WARNING Beware of the default hashCode() method in the Object class when
storing maps in a fi le. As you know, the hashcodes are generated from the address
of the object, so the hashcode for a key is entirely dependent on where it is stored in
memory. Getting a key back from a fi le in exactly the same place in memory where it
was originally stored is about as likely as fi nding hairs on a frog. The result is that when
you read a map back from a fi le, the hashcode generated from a key you now use to
access the map is diﬀerent from what was originally produced when you stored the
object with the key, so you will never fi nd the entry in the map to which it corresponds.
There is a solution to the problem. You must override the default hashCode() method
so that the hashcodes for keys are produced from the data members of the key objects.
This ensures that the hashcode for a given key is always the same. The Person class
does exactly this by overriding the hashCode() method.
