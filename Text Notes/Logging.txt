**JAVA LOGGING API**
Concept 
	Loggers: loggers are responsible for capturing events and passing them to the appropriate appender (handler).
	Handlers (Appenders): handlers are responsible for recording log events to a destination. Handlers use layouts to format events before sending them to an output.
	Formatters (Layouts): formatters are responsible for converting and formatting the data in a log event. Formatters determine how the data looks when it appears in a log entry.
	Log flow: application(log event command) -> (filter check) logger(level check) -> handler(level check)  -> (Formatter) -> outside world (log msg)
		When a Logger records an event, it forwards it to the appropriate Appender(Handler)
		The Appender then formats the log entry using a Layout before sending it to the console, to a file, or to another destination. 
		In addition, Filters let you further specify whether an Appender should be used for a specific log entry.
	A Logger can have multiple Handlers (with each handler have different set of level, for example print Finest to file but only severe to Console);
Creating a new Logger
	Create a new Logger object
		Usually one logger per class, so it can be static
		If a Logger with that name already exists, then that Logger is returned
		Example:
			private static Logger theLogger = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class.getName());
	Logger Naming
		It is recommended ot use the fully qualified name of the class.
		It should be in some sort of hierarchy when each level is separated with a dot.
		The fully qualified class name provides this hierarchy. But it does NOT create the parent loggers!
Logging Events
		Use the various methods on the Logger object to log an event. 
			.log(level, message)
			.level(message) - convenient methods to create log msgs for the specified level
			.logp() (log precise) lets you specify the source class and method for each log entry
			.logrb() (log with resource bundle) lets you specify a resource bundle to extract logs from. 
			.entering()
			.exiting() methods let you log method calls for tracing the execution flow of your program.
		Example:
			theLogger.finest("Hello logging!");
	Logging Levels
		Description
			Because we want to leave logging code in an application that goes into production, we need logging to cost us very little at runtime when it is not being used. 
			To help achieve this, the logging system defines a class called Level to specify the importance of a logging record. 
		Logging Levels:
			SEVERE	The highest value; intended for extremely important messages (e.g. fatal program errors).
			WARNING	Intended for warning messages.
			INFO	Informational runtime messages. By default, only records at the Level.INFO level or higher will be logged to the console
			CONFIG	Informational messages about configuration settings/setup.
			FINE	Used for greater detail, when debugging/diagnosing problems.
			FINER	Even greater detail.
			FINEST	The lowest value; greatest detail.
			ALL		Log everything
			OFF		Turn of logging
		Setting the Level for a Logger object
			Set the log level specifying which message levels will be logged by this logger. 
			Message levels lower than this value will be discarded. The level value Level.OFF can be used to turn off logging.
			Example:
				loggerObject.setLevel(Level.FINE)
		Setting the level for a package 
			We could set the logging level for a package, or even a set of packages by calling the LogManager.setLevel(String name, Level level) method. 
			If a Logger's level was explicitely set, it will keep that level. To get the package's level, set it to null
			Example: 
				LogManager.getLogManager().setLevel("logging", Level.FINE); //set the logging level of all loggers to Level.FINE with package prefix 'logging'
Handlers
	When a record is logged to a Logger, that Logger actually delegates the output of the record to a subclass of the Handler class.
	Each Handler has its own Level, in additon to the one for the Logger. The handler's level can be set as well
	A logger can have multiple handlers. When logging, messages forwarded to all handlers if a Logger has multiple handlers.
	Adding a Handler
		logger.addHandler(new ConsoleHandler());
		or
		Handler newHandler = new ConsoleHandler();
		logger.addHandler(newHandler);
	Removing a Handler
		logger.remove(newHandler);
	Types of Handlers
		ConsoleHandler
			Prints the log message to the console
		FileHandler
			The FileHandler writes all messages to file. 
			This can either be a single file, or a set of rotated files. 
			If rotated files are used, each file is filled to a certain size limit, after which a new file is created. Each file name is composed of a base name and a sequence number.
			Filename Patterns
							Code	Meaning
				/	The file name separator of the system. Typically either \ or / .
				%t	The temp directory of the system.
				%h	The user home directory of the system.
				%g	The generation number that distinguishes the rotated log files from each other.
				%u	A unique number to avoid naming conflicts.
				%%	A single percent sign, in case you want to use that in your file name.
			Creating a FileHandler
				FileHandler handler = new FileHandler(); //users the Configuration file propreties, save file to user home
				FileHandler handler2 = new FileHandler("J:/logfilename.txt"); 
				FileHandler handler3 = new FileHandler("myapp-log.%u.%g.txt", 1024 * 1024, 10, true); //pattern, filesize limit (1024*1024), file count, APPEND)
				logger.addHandler(handler);
		StreamHandler
		SocketHandler
		MemoryHandler
Filters
	Filters provide further control what records get logged. They can be attached to both Loggers and Handlers.
	The Filter can either accept or reject the message. If the message is accepted, the message is forwarded to the Handler's set on the Logger
	Example:
		Logger -> Handler(s) -> output
			|		|
		Filter	  Filter
	The record must pass 
		a) the Logger's level check, 
		b) the Logger's Filter, 
		c) the Handler's level check, 
		d)  the Handler's Filter before it would actually be sent to the outside world. 
	This allows things to start out simple (with no filters) and become more sophisticated as needed. 
	To get at just the right information without altering the behavior of the program too much is the key to learning what needs to be known.
	Create a filter
		Filter filter = new MyFilterImpl();  //MyFilterImpl class must be implementing the Filter interface!
		logger.setFilter(filter);
Formatters
	Predefinded formatters
		SimpleFormatter
		XMLFormatter
	Creating custom formatters
		Examples:
			Handler ch = new consoleHandler();
			ch.setFormatter(new XMLformatter());
			Logger.addHandler(ch);
			or
			logger.addHandler(setFormatter(new MyFormatter));	//MyFormatter class must extend to Formatter
		Simple Sample of a custom Formatter class
			public class MyFormatter extends Formatter { @Override public String format(LogRecord record) { return  record.getLevel() + ":" + record.getMessage(); } } 
LogRecord
	getLevel()
	getLoggerName()
	getMessage()
	getMillis()
	getParameters()
	getResourceBundle()
	getResourceBundleName()
	getSequenceNumber()
	getSourceClassName()
	getSourceMethodName()
	getThreadID()
	getThrown()
LogManager
	In terms of logging levels, it allows us to set different logging levels for different "areas" of the program. 
	To understand this, we need to think of our program as being broken down into different areas based on the package prefix of the classes involved
Configuration
	The logging API has a configuration file and by default, it provides a handler that will send logging messages, in the form of a LogRecord to the console (System.err).
	Configuration File
		Standard property file with key:value pairs
		C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_101\jre\lib\logging.properties
Logging Hierarchy and Record Forwarding
	Once a particular Logger decides to log a LogRecord, the Logger not only passes it to any Handler(s) attached to it, but it also forwards the record to its parent Logger. 
	The parent Logger does not perform a Level or Filter check, but instead forwards it to any attached Handler(s) and forwards it to its parent Logger. 
	Eventually, the record reaches the root Logger. 
	The root Logger has a ConsoleHandler that produces the output we see. 
	Note that this forwarding behavior be controlled via the setUseParentHandlers(boolean) method in the Logger class.


root 				->	filter - Logger - Handler 
									|
com					->	filter - Logger - Handler 
									|
com.domain 			->	filter - Logger - Handler 
									^
com.domain.project 	->	filter - Logger	- Handler


**3rd party Logging Frameworks**
	Log4j, Logback, and tinylog. 
	Other packages, such as SLF4J and Apache Commons Logging, provide abstraction layers which decouple your code from the underlying logging framework, allowing you to switch between logging frameworks.

Abstraction Layers (SLF4J)
	Abstraction layers such as SLF4J decouple your application from its logging framework. 
	An application can choose to bind a specific logging framework (such as java.util.logging, Log4j, or Logback) at run time by including that framework on the application’s classpath. 
	If a logging framework is not available on the classpath, the abstraction layer effectively disables log calls. 
	Abstraction layers make it easier to change a project’s existing framework and to integrate projects that use different frameworks.
