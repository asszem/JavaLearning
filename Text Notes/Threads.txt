Creating Threads
	Implement Runnable vs. Extend Thread
		Because Java allows only a single base class, if you derive your class from Thread, it can't inherit functionality from any other class.
		The Runnable interface declares only one method, run(), and this is the method that is executed when the thread is started.
Methods
	.start()
	.sleep()
	.interrupt()
	.isInterrupted()
	.interrupted()
	.join()
	.yield()
		When you call the sleep() method for a thread, the thread does not continue for at least the time you have specified as an argument, even if no other threads are waiting. 
		Calling yield(), on the other hand, causes the current thread to resume immediately if no threads are waiting
