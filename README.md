# JavaLearning
This is a repository I created while I was learning Java (and GitHub). 

Content:
 - sample Java source codes organized in packages for various aspects of Java
 - text notes I compiled from various sources (mainly Ivor Horton's Beginning Java 7 book)
 - exercises (Coding bat, Horton's)
 - sandbox for practice
