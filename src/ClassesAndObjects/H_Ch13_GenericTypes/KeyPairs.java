/**
 * Example of using multiple type variables

 *
 * This would typically arise where one object is used as a key to access another object that represents a value in a collection. 
 * 
 * For example, you might store Person objects in a collection that encapsulates personal details
 * such as the name, the address, and the phone number. 
 * 
 * You could associate each Person object with a Name object that you use as a key to retrieve the Person object. 
 * 
 * One way of establishing the association between an object and its key is to encapsulate both in another object â€” of type Pair
